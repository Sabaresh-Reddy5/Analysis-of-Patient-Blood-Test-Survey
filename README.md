# Analysis-of-Patient-Blood-Test-Survey
This project performs a detailed data analysis of patient blood test survey data to uncover health trends and insights. By cleaning and exploring a dataset of blood test metrics (such as blood count parameters, glucose, cholesterol, etc.), the analysis identifies common patterns, distributions, and anomalies across patient samples. Visualization tools (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) are used to highlight key relationships—such as how different biomarkers correlate with each other and how they vary across demographics (age, gender). The project also applies basic statistical techniques and potentially predictive modeling (e.g., regression or classification) to flag out-of-range values and assess risk factors. Overall, it demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and insight generation, helping medical professionals or researchers understand important trends in blood test results.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing patient blood test data to identify trends, abnormal values, and overall health indicators. Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that helps medical professionals and researchers easily interpret patient-level biomarkers and discover patterns that support early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

The dataset contains values such as Hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, Platelets, Glucose, and other critical parameters. The dashboard transforms raw clinical data into meaningful insights through clean visual storytelling.

🧪 Case Study Summary

A hospital wanted to analyze patient blood test results to identify early signs of health risks. Using Power BI, I built a dashboard that connects biomarkers with demographic filters. Through EDA and DAX-driven KPIs, abnormal values were highlighted instantly, enabling faster medical review. This helped convert raw lab results into actionable clinical intelligence.
